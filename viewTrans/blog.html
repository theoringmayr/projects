          <h3>Monkeys can't be trusted</h3>
          <p>
            Escaped monkeys have caused chaos and fascination throughout
            history. In 1935, around 175 rhesus macaques broke free from a Long
            Island menagerie, leading to days of mayhem as they blocked trains,
            raided fruit stands, and evaded capture, with newspapers nationwide
            following their antics. More recently, 43 rhesus macaques escaped
            from a research facility in South Carolina, prompting warnings for
            residents to secure their homes. The monkeys, described as bold and
            curious, were eventually recaptured without harm. Such incidents
            highlight both the intelligence and adaptability of monkeys, as well
            as the challenges in containing these agile animals.
