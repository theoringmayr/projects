          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Kikin is an alternative to traditional financing that rewards
            sustainable businesses. It offers a fast, easy, affordable way for
            purpose-driven businesses to get the money they need. The team came
            to us as an early-stage startup, in need of an identity that focused
            on their USPs – cooperation and community.
          </p>

        <a href="#strategy">
          <h2>Strategy</h2>
          <p>
            Based on their strategy, we came up with a brand idea that follows a
            simple logic: give good, get good back. Kikin backs better business
            and a brighter future for people and the planet. When people band
            together to work towards a common goal, real change happens.
          </p>
        </a>

        <a href="#identity">
          <h2>Identity</h2>
          <p>
            We built an identity around the idea of harmony between people and
            planet. It’s underpinned by outdoor adventure club-like references
            and a bespoke illustration style that adds a sense of depth. They
            give hints at park rangers, mountains and woodcut artworks with two
            brand landscapes laying the foundation for Koto's Kikin commandment
            badges.

        <a href="#application">
          <h2>Application</h2>
          <p>
            Alongside the brand identity, we helped them design with their
            website: first, with a simple landing page for people to join the
            waiting list; and further down the line with a homepage to tell the
            story of the company and its benefits, in an interactive and
            engaging way.
          </p>
        </a>
        <a href="#outcome">
          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>
            We created a brand with humanity at its heart, for a business that
            gives like-minded founders the access to information and funding
            usually saved for the larger companies. It clearly sends a message
            that Kikin stands for people and planet working together to create a
            better future. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing
