          When a friend decided to leave his desk job to work with his hands, he
          thought he just needed a logo. But starting a landscaping business in
          Brandenburg meant more than good work—it meant looking the part from
          day one.

          The local landscaping scene told its own story. Pixelated logos,
          clipart, and Comic Sans dominated. For homeowners looking for reliable
          service, there were no visual cues to inspire confidence.

          Through early conversations, a picture emerged. This wasn't about
          being the cheapest or the flashiest. It was about being the
          professional choice—someone homeowners could trust to show up, do
          quality work, and communicate clearly.

          I explored three visual directions—from traditional craftsman
