            Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having
            little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest
            me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the
            watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the
            spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself
            growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly
            November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing
            before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral
            I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of
            me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from
            deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
            people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon
            as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a
            philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly
            take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but
            knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish
            very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

              extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed

              fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some
              seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of
              ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving
              to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of
              week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to

            It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio
            professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod
            was turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You
            would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the
            sea gods.

            In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other
            ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted
            green, and which no single man can possibly lift—this vast bunch of
            grapes was swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower
            mast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a ship’s deck. The end
            of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then
            conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles
            was swung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook,
            weighing some one hundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in
            stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with
            their long spades, began cutting a hole in the body for the
            insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins.
            This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the
            hook is inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up a wild
            chorus, now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass.
            When instantly, the entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt
            in her starts like the nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather;
            she trembles, quivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky.
            More and more she leans over to the whale, while every gasping heave
            of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows;
            till at last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash
            the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the
            triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged
            semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as the blubber
            envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it
            stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes
            stripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the
            windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the
            water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the
            line called the “scarf,” simultaneously cut by the spades of
            Starbuck and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled
            off, and indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being
            hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the
            main-top; the men at the windlass then cease heaving, and for a
            moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as
            if let down from the sky, and every one present must take good heed
            to dodge it when it swings, else it may box his ears and pitch him
            headlong overboard.
