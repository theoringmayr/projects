          <p>
            Web Core Experience is an ecosystem of frameworks, tools, and
            features that utilize Machine Learning to transform how we develop
            personalized user experiences. It also drives more meaningful
            business metrics and improves the way we collaborate to build
            Booking.com’s Web products.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was a founding member responsible for coming up with the
            high-level design vision to get leadership buy-in, draft a roadmap
            to explore tangible outcomes with my product counterparts, and build
            a strong team of designers.

          <h3>The challenge</h3>

          <p>
            For a long time, our website was built for a single supply
            (Accommodations) and through a single business metric measuring
            bookings. Product teams were free to explore any real estate as long
            as their key metric was preserved. As a result, our product lacked a
            coherent approach for personalization and we weren’t serving our
            user’s diverse needs beyond booking a property.
          </p>

          <p>
            This approach also expected product teams to write bespoke code,
            internally coordinate with lots of other teams for placement, and
            invent their own way of measuring and monitoring success every time
            they released a new feature.

          <h3>Defining the vision</h3>

          <p>
            In collaboration with my research and product counterparts I came up
            with a design vision that demonstrates the opportunity of moving to
            a multi-purpose and multi-product universe. In order to achieve
            this, I realized that we would need to build an ecosystem powered by
            Machine Learning. In collaboration with engineering, I designed this
            ecosystem and illustrated how it will work.

          <p>
            We chose our website’s homepage as our initial testing ground due to
            its organic visitors and the diverse use cases it accommodates. I
            created a pitch deck detailing the problem, the proposed solution,
            and the homepage use case to get buy-in, raise awareness, gather
            feedback, and figure out collaboration opportunities.
